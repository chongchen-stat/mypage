		    <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
		    <p>
		    	I like statistics, its application in finance and Mozart. I also enjoy "learning" in general.

		    <h2>Computer programming</h2>
		    <ul>

		    <h2>Biograph</h2>
		    <p>I received my B.Sc. in Statistics and Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. Meanwhile I have been a teaching assistance in various statistics courses during the last few years. <a href="MyPage_Teaching.html">Here</a>  are partial notes from my previous teaching. Recently, I am interested in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computer algorithms.</p>
		    <p>Personally, I am a swimmer by training since I was 10.</p>
		    <p>In February 2020, before pandemic, my comrade and I bet against hotels and airline companies in stock market. Later in September, we were also the first few groups of people, who found out shorts on <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch">GameStop</a> were overextended by hedge funds. In both cases, 10% of my profit were donated to the child welfare agency.</p>
		    <p>In brief, a bit of philanthropist, a bit of misanthropist, all statistics enthusiast.</p>
